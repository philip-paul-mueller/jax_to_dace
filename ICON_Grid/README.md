# INFO
These folder contains the grid data.
To access these grids you should use the `init_grid_manager()` function defined in the `icondims.py` file in the parent folder.
They will build a grid manager object and by calling `get_grid()` on them you will get the underlying grid.

Before you can create them you have to download them:
- `mch_ch_r04b09_dsl_grid`: "https://polybox.ethz.ch/index.php/s/hD232znfEPBh4Oh/download"
- `r02b04_global_grid`: "https://polybox.ethz.ch/index.php/s/0EM8O8U53GKGsst/download"

They are ignored by git.
